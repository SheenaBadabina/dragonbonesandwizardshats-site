The apprentice notices it during morning lessons. 

His master's shadow bends left when the wizard moves right. It lingers three seconds after he walks away. Sometimes, in candlelight, it *smiles*.

"Master," the boy whispers. "Your shadow—"

The old wizard's face goes pale. "You can see it?"

"It's... it's not moving with you."

The master closes his eyes. His hands tremble. "Forty years ago, I traded my shadow to a demon for the power to save this kingdom. What walks behind me now is the demon itself. Wearing my shape. Waiting."

"Waiting for what?"

"For the contract to end." The wizard's voice cracks. "For today."

The apprentice watches in horror as the shadow peels itself from the floor. It rises. Solidifies. Takes three-dimensional form—still wearing the wizard's face, but wrong. Inverted. Grinning.

The demon speaks with his master's voice: "Thank you for forty years of darkness, old friend. Now I'll take the light."

The shadow steps forward. The wizard's body casts no darkness anymore.
