The first child unwraps the candy and screams.

"Cold," she gasps. "So cold. Water everywhere. I can't breathe—"

The grandmother at the door smiles. "1847. You drowned in a river crossing. You were seven years old."

The next child tastes fire. Smoke choking his lungs. Wooden beams collapsing. He drops the candy, shaking.

"House fire. 1923. You were ten."

One by one, the children taste their deaths. A fall from great heights. A fever that burned for days. A blade in the dark.

Then Tommy unwraps his piece. The candy tastes like righteousness. Like torches and screaming. Like a woman burning.

He looks up. The grandmother's smile vanishes.

"You remember now, don't you, witch hunter?" Her voice drops to ice. "You tied me to that stake. You lit the fire. You watched me burn while the village cheered."

Tommy's hands tremble. The memory floods back—another life, another name. The trial. The execution. Her eyes meeting his through the flames.

"I've waited three hundred years," she whispers. "All these children tasted death. But you, Thomas Crane?"

The candy in his palm begins to smoke.

"You get to taste it again."
