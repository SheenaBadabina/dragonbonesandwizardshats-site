The house at the end of Maple Street only appears on Halloween.

Emma knows this because her mother warned her. Every October 31st, between the normal houses with their plastic skeletons and inflatable ghosts, a Victorian mansion materializes in the empty lot. Dark windows. A porch light that flickers purple. And a bowl of candy that glows.

The other kids say the candy grants wishes.

Emma's little brother vanished three years ago. She's seen his face on the missing posters—alongside dozens of others. All last seen on Halloween. All near Maple Street.

This year, Emma walks to the end of the block. The house is there, waiting. An old woman opens the door before Emma can knock. Her smile is too wide. Too knowing.

"Take one, dear."

The candy shimmers in Emma's palm. She can feel it—the promise. One wish. She could bring him back.

"What's the price?" Emma whispers.

The woman's smile grows wider. "Oh, child. You already paid it. The moment you knocked."

Emma looks down. Her shadow is gone. Not hidden—*gone*. And in the windows behind the witch, she sees them. All the missing children. Trapped in glass. Shadowless. Reaching.

The door closes. The house fades.

Emma is still standing on the empty lot, holding candy that tastes like forgetting.
