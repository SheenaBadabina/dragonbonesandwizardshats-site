        <p>Raven was a master thief who never stole the same thing twice. She took gold from the rich, secrets from the powerful, and once—according to rumor—the moon’s reflection from a royal pond. Her legend was a whisper between shadows, a name never spoken above candlelight.</p>
        <p>Until the night she stole from Chronus himself—the god of time.</p>
        <p>Hidden deep beneath the Plaza of Echoes stood the Tower of Chronus. Its gears turned not with metal, but with seconds. Inside, among ticking hearts of bronze and light, rested the Hourglass of Hours—an artifact that measured the flow of tomorrow into today.</p>
        <p>She hadn’t meant to break it. Truly, she hadn’t.</p>
        <p>But when her gloved hand brushed its rim, the glass cracked—not loudly, not dramatically. Just enough. Enough for tomorrow to start leaking out.</p>
        <p>She felt it immediately. The world stuttered. The bells stopped mid-chime. A falling droplet of water froze midair like a bead of glass. And then—silence. The kind of silence that only exists when time itself forgets to move.</p>
        <p>When she opened her eyes again, she wasn’t alone. Time-wraiths—pale as unstruck bells—hovered in the still air, their hollow faces drawn toward her heartbeat. One moved closer. Its fingers brushed her shoulder, and every memory she’d ever had—childhood, her first theft, her first friend—flashed before her eyes like pages burning in reverse.</p>
        <p>“You broke the hourglass,” said a voice that was both everywhere and nowhere. Chronus. The god of time. He stood at the edge of the frozen plaza, ageless and patient, his eyes holding the color of forgotten dawns.</p>
        <p>“You may keep your life,” he said, “but time demands balance. To fix what you have broken, you must pay in kind.”</p>
        <p>He raised his hand, and a doorway of clockwork light opened—a spiral leading downward, deep beneath the roots of the tower. “Welcome to the Underclock.”</p>
        <p>She descended.</p>
        <p>The Underclock was not a place—it was the machinery beneath existence. Here, pendulums swung through eternity. Here, hours grew like vines, twisting and coiling in luminous patterns. Here, she saw the leak: a slow drip of golden sand spilling into the void.</p>
        <p>Every drop was a lost tomorrow. Every grain, a forgotten sunrise.</p>
        <p>She tried to mend the crack. Her fingers trembled. The sand burned through her gloves, etching small constellations into her skin. But the crack widened. The wraiths hissed. Her reflection in the glass began to age—lines deepening, hair paling. Time was taking its payment.</p>
        <p>“What must I pay?” she cried.</p>
        <p>Chronus’s voice echoed from above. “Twenty years.”</p>
        <p>She hesitated. Twenty years. Two decades of life for the mistake of a heartbeat. She could run. She always ran. But something inside her—perhaps guilt, perhaps grace—anchored her feet.</p>
        <p>“Take them,” she said. And the sand stopped leaking.</p>
        <p>She awoke in the plaza again. The bells chimed. The droplet hit the ground. The world resumed as if nothing had ever paused. Only her reflection in the mirrored shop window betrayed her theft—her face older, her eyes lined with the weight of unseen years.</p>
        <p>Raven vanished that night. No one saw her again in the city of time.</p>
        <p>Years later, travelers told stories of a woman with silver hair who ran a small clock and lock shop by the sea. They said she could fix any timepiece, no matter how broken. They said she never charged children. They said she always paused, just before finishing a repair, to whisper something into the ticking heart of the clock.</p>
        <p>“Don’t waste it.”</p>
        <p>When Raven died at 87, which should have been 67, the clocks in her shop all stopped at once.</p>
        <p>And somewhere, far below the Plaza of Echoes, the Hourglass of Hours gleamed whole again.</p>
