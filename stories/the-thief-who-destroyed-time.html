      <div class="story-body">
        <p>In Aurathel, where spires kissed clouds and magic sang through stone, there lived a thief named Raven. Not just any thief. The best.</p>
        <p>She moved like smoke through moonlight. Like whispers through silence. Like secrets through dreams. Her fingers knew the language of locks, the poetry of tumblers, the songs that bronze and iron sang when properly persuaded. She had stolen starlight from merchant vaults. She had lifted crown jewels from sleeping kings. She had walked through walls of spell-ward and shadow-trap and emerged untouched, unscathed, unknown.</p>
        <p>The city watch spoke her name in hushed tones, though none could say what face matched the legend. Was she young or old? Tall or small? Beautiful or plain? No one knew. Raven wore shadows like other women wore silk, and she had never been caught. Never been seen. Never failed.</p>
        <p>But tonightâ€”ah, tonightâ€”she would attempt the impossible. Tonight, she would rob a wizard.</p>
        <p>The Tower of Chronus stood at the city's eastern edge, where streets twisted strange and time flowed like water over stonesâ€”sometimes fast, sometimes slow, never quite straight. The tower rose from darkness, built of black stone that drank light rather than reflected it. A single window burned high above, circular and pale as a winter moon, the only break in that seamless surface.</p>
        <p>Within that tower lived Chronus the Time-Keeper. Chronus the Eternal. Chronus who had counted every hour since the world was young, who measured out the days like a miser counting gold, who held the threads of past and future in his ancient hands.</p>
        <p>Most thieves gave wizards wide berth. Magic made mockery of careful plans. But Raven was not most thieves.</p>
        <p>And she had heard whispers. Rumors like autumn leaves, drifting through the Thieves' Market. Tales of a treasure beyond measure, kept in Chronus's highest chamber. An hourglass, they said. Not of common glass and sand, but something older. Something precious. Something that held not gold, but time itself. Tomorrow, captured in crystal and starlight. Worth a kingdom's ransom. Worth a lifetime's glory. Worth the risk.</p>
        <p>For three weeks, Raven watched. She learned the wizard's rhythms like a musician learns a song. Each evening, as the sun kissed the horizon and painted the sky in shades of amber and rose, Chronus emerged. The tower's door would appearâ€”sudden as memory, solid as stoneâ€”and the wizard would step forth.</p>
        <p>He was tall. Thin as winter branches. Draped in robes of midnight black, embroidered with silver threads that formed constellations she did not recognize. His face held no ageâ€”neither young nor old, neither kind nor cruel. But his eyes. Oh, his eyes were wrong. They held too much. Every moment he had witnessed. Every second he had counted. Every heartbeat of every hour since time began, all of it swimming in those fathomless gray eyes.</p>
        <p>Each evening, he walked to the Plaza of Echoes. Each evening, he stood before the great sundial. Each evening, he performed some ritualâ€”hands moving in patterns, lips forming words that bent the air around themâ€”and each evening, he was gone exactly one hour. One hour. Perfect.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the sun began its descent. Orange light spilled across rooftops like honey, like wine, like liquid gold. Raven crouched atop the Clock-Maker's Guild, wrapped in her shadow-cloakâ€”her most prized possession, woven from darkness and silence, from secrets and forgotten dreams.</p>
        <p>She watched. She waited.</p>
        <p>The tower's door appeared. Chronus emerged, a silhouette against the dying light, and walked toward the plaza. The door vanished.</p>
        <p>Raven counted to sixtyâ€”one breath for each second, steady as a heartbeatâ€”and then she moved.</p>
        <p>The tower had no entrance now. But Raven had not expected one. She approached the eastern wall where the stone was oldest, where time had worn channels deep as scars. Her fingers traced the surface, reading the stone like a blind woman reads raised letters, until she found it: a crack, hairline thin, warm to the touch.</p>
        <p>Time leaked from it like heat from a hearth. Like light from a lantern. Like blood from a wound.</p>
        <p>She withdrew a vial from her beltâ€”basilisk oil, bought at considerable cost from an alchemist who asked no questions. She traced the crack with one careful drop. The oil hissed. Smoked. The crack widened, reluctant, and she slipped through into darkness.</p>
        <p>Inside, the tower was vast. Impossibly vast.</p>
        <p>The chamber stretched before her, circular and high-ceilinged, larger than the tower's outer dimensions should allow. The walls were lined with clocksâ€”hundreds upon hundredsâ€”all ticking in different rhythms, different tempos, creating a sound like rain on leaves, like distant thunder, like the world's heartbeat counting down to something inevitable.</p>
        <p>Pendulums swung. Gears turned. Springs coiled and uncoiled. Some clocks ran backward. Some stood frozen mid-tick. Some seemed to count seconds that did not exist in any mortal reckoning.</p>
        <p>And rising through the chamber's heart, a spiral staircase of brass and bronze wound upward into shadow.</p>
        <p>Raven climbed.</p>
        <p>Each step rang out despite her cloak, as if the metal remembered every footfall that had ever graced its surface and insisted on honoring them all. She passed landing after landing. Rooms opened like flowersâ€”a library where books wrote themselves, ink flowing across pages in languages that shifted as she watched. A chamber of mirrors that showed not her reflection but her future, her past, a thousand versions of herself she might have been. A gallery of hourglasses in every size and color, their sands flowing up instead of down, or sideways, or in spirals that defied all logic.</p>
        <p>She did not pause. Did not linger. Time, after all, was not on her side.</p>
        <p>Up and up she climbed, until at last she reached the top.</p>
        <p>The uppermost chamber stole her breath.</p>
        <p>The walls were not walls but windowsâ€”one great circular window that showed not the city below but something else. The night sky, but not as mortals saw it. Stars beyond counting, swirling in patterns that made her eyes water and her heart ache with a beauty too vast for human comprehension. Galaxies turning like wheels. Nebulae blooming like flowers. The universe itself, laid bare.</p>
        <p>And in the center of the room, on a pedestal of white marble veined with gold, sat the hourglass.</p>
        <p>It was small. No larger than her hand. The glass was clear as mountain water, as transparent as truth, as pure as first snow. The frame was wrought of silver so fine it seemed spun from moonlight itself.</p>
        <p>And the sand. Oh, the sand.</p>
        <p>It was not sand at all. It was light. Liquid light. Each grain a tiny star, falling from upper chamber to lower in a cascade that sangâ€”yes, sangâ€”a music she could feel in her bones, in her blood, in the deepest chambers of her heart. She could see time in that flow. Could feel tomorrow pouring through the narrow waist of glass, each grain a moment yet to come, each fall the universe stepping forward into the endless dance of existence.</p>
        <p>It was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.</p>
        <p>And she wanted it with a hunger that surprised her. Not for the gold it would bring, though the gold would be considerable. Not for the fame, though stealing from Chronus would make her legend immortal. She wanted it because it was impossible. Because it was beautiful. Because she was Raven, and she took impossible, beautiful things.</p>
        <p>She approached with care, watching for traps. Pressure plates. Tripwires. Spell-wards woven into the air itself. But there was nothing. The pedestal stood unguarded, as if Chronus had never imagined someone might reach this place.</p>
        <p>Pride, she thought. Wizards always believed themselves beyond the reach of ordinary folk.</p>
        <p>She reached out. Her fingers closed around the hourglass. Warm. Alive. Humming with power that made her bones vibrate like struck bells.</p>
        <p>She lifted it from the pedestal. Nothing happened. No alarms. No spell-traps. No guardian erupting from the floor in fury and flame.</p>
        <p>Raven allowed herself a smile. She tucked the hourglass into her leather satchel, cushioned with velvet, and turned toward the stairs.</p>
        <p>The window shattered.</p>
        <p>Not the glassâ€”the glass remained whole. But the image shattered. The beautiful cosmos broke apart like a dropped mirror, and through the cracks poured something else. Darkness. Writhing, living darkness. And within it, shapes. Terrible shapes. Things with too many limbs and eyes that gleamed like polished stone. Things that made sounds like clocks winding down, like gears grinding to a halt, like the dying gasp of time itself.</p>
        <p>Time-wraiths.</p>
        <p>Chronus had not left the hourglass unguarded after all. He had simply set a trap that sprung on removal, not approach. Clever bastard.</p>
        <p>Raven ran.</p>
        <p>Down the spiral stairs, three steps at a time, her cloak billowing behind her like wings, like smoke, like the shadow of some great dark bird. The wraiths followedâ€”flowing, writhing, their ticking growing louder, more desperate, more hungry.</p>
        <p>She burst through chambers that now felt hostile. The library's books snapped at her with pages sharp as knives. The mirrors cracked, spilling reflections that reached for her with glass-shard fingers. The hourglasses exploded one by one, their impossible sands scattering like stars dying.</p>
        <p>One wraith got close. Its handâ€”if that elongated, jointed thing could be called a handâ€”brushed her shoulder. Cold. Such cold. And in that instant of contact, she felt something being ripped away. Small memories. Precious memories. The taste of her mother's bread. The sound of rain on a summer afternoon. The smell of autumn leaves burning. Moments stolen, devoured, unmade.</p>
        <p>She twisted free, gasping, and drew a knife. Hurled it at the wraith's center. The blade passed through like smoke through air. Of course. They were not flesh. They were time's guardians, and you cannot kill time with steel.</p>
        <p>She hit the ground floor at a dead run, dove through the crack in the wall, and rolled into the street beyond. Behind her, the wraiths crashed against the tower's outer wall and recoiled, shrieking their mechanical shrieks, unable or unwilling to leave their master's domain.</p>
        <p>Raven lay there a moment, breathing hard, heart hammering. Then she ran again, disappearing into Aurathel's maze of shadows and secrets, making for her safe house.</p>
        <p>She did not notice, in her haste, that the hourglass had cracked. Just a hairline fracture. Small as a whisper. And through it, grain by precious grain, tomorrow was beginning to leak away.</p>
        <p>Raven reached her sanctuary as midnight approachedâ€”a narrow building squeezed between a bakery and a seamstress's shop, its entrance hidden behind a false wall that only she could find. Inside, she lit candles with shaking hands and set the hourglass on her table.</p>
        <p>Even in candlelight, it glowed. Even stolen, it was beautiful.</p>
        <p>She poured wineâ€”expensive vintage she'd been savingâ€”and raised the glass in a toast to herself. "To tomorrow," she whispered, and drank deep.</p>
        <p>Then she saw it. The crack.</p>
        <p>Thin as spider's silk, running down the glass's side. And at its base, a tiny pile of luminous sand. Perhaps a dozen grains. No more.</p>
        <p>Her stomach dropped.</p>
        <p>She picked up the hourglass, turning it in the light. As she watched, another grain slipped through the crack and fell to the table. When it touched the wood, it winked out. Just gone. Not transferred. Not preserved. Unmade.</p>
        <p>"No," she breathed. "No, no, no."</p>
        <p>But wishing could not seal the crack. And the sand kept falling.</p>
        <p>She wrapped the hourglass carefully and went to bed, telling herself that morning would bring solutions. That everything looked better in daylight. But morning did not come.</p>
        <p>She woke to darkness. Complete, total darkness. The candle beside her bed would not lightâ€”sparks died before they could catch, as if the very air rejected flame. Finally, on the seventh attempt, a weak light sputtered to life. Dim. Struggling.</p>
        <p>She went to the window.</p>
        <p>The city was dark. Every lantern dead. Every mage-light extinguished. The only illumination came from the moon, hanging in the sky exactly where it had been when she slept. Exactly where. Not moving. Not setting. Frozen.</p>
        <p>She watched for a full minute. The moon did not move. The stars did not wheel. Time itself had stopped, and Raven knewâ€”with the terrible certainty of someone who has broken something irreplaceableâ€”that she had stolen more than treasure. She had stolen tomorrow. And now tomorrow was leaking away into nothing.</p>
        <p>The streets were chaos. People screaming, weeping, pointing at the frozen moon. The watch trying to maintain order but looking as frightened as everyone else. Torches burned fitfully, as if even fire was uncertain in this strange, stopped world.</p>
        <p>Raven moved through the panic, heading for the Plaza of Echoes.</p>
        <p>The journey took forever. Or no time at all. One step carried her fifty paces. Another step took an eternity to complete. Time was breaking down, unraveling like old cloth, and she could feel it happening.</p>
        <p>When she reached the plaza, Chronus was already there. Standing before his sundial. Waiting.</p>
        <p>"Thief," he said softly. Not angry. Worse than angry. Disappointed. "I wondered if you would come, or if you would hide while the world ended."</p>
        <p>Raven's hand went to her knife. Useless gesture, but old habits die hard. "The hourglass cracked. I didn't meanâ€”"</p>
        <p>"Intentions," Chronus interrupted, "are irrelevant. You stole the Hourglass of Hours. You broke the vessel that holds tomorrow. Every grain of sand within it is a moment yet to come. While intact, tomorrow flows into today, today into yesterday, and time moves forward as it must. But now?" He gestured at the frozen sky. "Now tomorrow bleeds away. And when the final grain falls, there will be no more. Just this moment, eternal and unchanging. Forever."</p>
        <p>"How long?" Her voice was barely a whisper.</p>
        <p>"Three days. Perhaps less. Hard to say when days themselves are ending."</p>
        <p>"Then fix it! You're a wizard. You made it. Fix it!"</p>
        <p>Chronus shook his head. "I did not make it, child. The hourglass is older than kingdoms. Older than language. It was given to me by the first wizards, who received it from beings whose names are lost to time itself. I am merely its keeper. Its guardian. But repair?" He smiled sadly. "That is beyond even me."</p>
        <p>Raven felt the world tilting beneath her feet. "Then everyone dies. Everything ends. Because of me."</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>She stood there, drowning in that single word, until another thought surfaced. "There must be a way. Somewhere. Someone who can fix it."</p>
        <p>"Perhaps," Chronus said slowly. "There is a place. The Underclock. It exists beneath reality, beneath time itself. The machinery of existence. If the hourglass can be repaired, it would be there. Butâ€”"</p>
        <p>"But?"</p>
        <p>"The Underclock is not meant for living things. Time does not flow there. You may enter and leave in seconds, or centuries. You may age to dust in a heartbeat, or not age at all. The paths are treacherous. The dangers innumerable. And if you reach the Repair Chamber, the Underclock will demand payment."</p>
        <p>"What payment?"</p>
        <p>"Time," Chronus said simply. "The Underclock accepts only time. And it will want a great deal."</p>
        <p>Chronus raised one hand. His fingers moved in patterns that hurt to watch, tracing symbols in the air that burned with cold fire. The air itself split openâ€”a tear in reality, and beyond it, something impossible. Gears. Gears the size of mountains. Chains of gold and silver descending into infinite darkness. Pendulums swinging in arcs that took minutes to complete. And everywhere, glowing blue lines pulsing like veins, like rivers, like the threads that held the universe together.</p>
        <p>"Through here," Chronus said. "Descend. Find the Central Chamber. Present the hourglass. The Underclock will respond."</p>
        <p>Raven stared at the opening. Every instinct screamed at her to run. To hide. To let someone else clean up this mess. But there was no one else. She had stolen tomorrow. Now she would have to steal it back.</p>
        <p>"If I die in there?"</p>
        <p>"Then you will never have existed," Chronus said quietly. "And no one will remember you were ever born."</p>
        <p>Raven nodded once. Adjusted her cloak. Checked her knifeâ€”useless, probably, but familiar and comforting. Then she stepped through the tear and descended into the place where time was made.</p>
        <p>The ticking was the first thing. Not gentle. Not quiet. Vast. The heartbeat of existence itself, thundering through her bones, her blood, her soul. A million million gears turning in perfect synchronization, creating a rhythm that was less sound than presence.</p>
        <p>She stood on a platform of dark metal, suspended in infinite space. Above, below, besideâ€”machinery stretched endlessly. Gears rotating slowly, majestically. Springs coiling and uncoiling. Chains ascending and descending. And threaded through it all, those glowing blue lines, pulsing with the rhythm of creation itself.</p>
        <p>Behind her, the tear sealed with a sound like a door closing in an empty house. No return.</p>
        <p>Ahead, a corridor formed by the machinery, gears parting just enough to allow passage. There was only one direction. Down.</p>
        <p>She walked.</p>
        <p>Time felt strange here. Wrong. She tried counting steps but kept losing track. Tried humming a song but the melody kept changing in her memory. The corridor descended through chambers of impossible complexityâ€”clocks within clocks, mechanisms so delicate that watching them made her eyes water.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, through gaps in the machinery, she glimpsed figures tending the gears. Tall, thin, with too many joints in their arms and legs. The Clockwork Keepers. She did not call out. Some instinct told her their attention would not be kind.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the corridor opened into a chamber. Circular. Perhaps fifty feet across. The walls were rotating gears, each one showing a different frozen momentâ€”her own safe house, the Plaza of Echoes, a child caught mid-laugh, a bird suspended between wing-beats.</p>
        <p>And in the center stood a figure. Not human. Composed entirely of bronze and silver and brass. Arms that moved with mechanical precision. A torso of visible gears. And for a faceâ€”a clock. Beautiful. Ornate. With three hands moving in different directions at different speeds.</p>
        <p>When it spoke, the voice came from everywhere and nowhere.</p>
        <p>"Thief who stole tomorrow. You have come to repair what you broke."</p>
        <p>Raven withdrew the hourglass. The crack had widened significantly. Perhaps half the sand remained.</p>
        <p>"I need it fixed," she said, surprised her voice was steady.</p>
        <p>"Show me."</p>
        <p>A platform rose between them. She placed the hourglass upon it carefully.</p>
        <p>The figure leaned forward, clock-face clicking as it examined the damage. "Repairable. Difficult. The glass is ancient. The sands irreplaceable. What has leaked cannot be recovered. But the rest can be saved."</p>
        <p>"Then save it. Please. I'll pay whateverâ€”"</p>
        <p>"The price is time. Twenty years."</p>
        <p>Twenty years. Raven was twenty-four. This would make her forty-four. Middle-aged. Past her prime. Her thieving days over. Her youth gone like smoke. But the alternative was the end of tomorrow for everyone.</p>
        <p>"Wait," she said slowly. "You said the price is twenty years. You didn't say whose twenty years."</p>
        <p>The clock-face tilted. The hands spun. "Clever. Yes. The time need not be yours. Bring us twenty years from any source. The Underclock does not discriminate."</p>
        <p>Her heart went cold. "You want me to steal someone else's time?"</p>
        <p>"We want nothing. We state the price. How you pay is your concern."</p>
        <p>She could do it. Find someone. A criminal. Someone dying anyway. Someone who deserved it. Make them pay for her mistake. But that would make her a killer. And she had stolen many thingsâ€”gold, jewels, secrets, hopeâ€”but never a life. Never that. It was the only line she had never crossed.</p>
        <p>"Is there another way?"</p>
        <p>"No. Time is the only currency here."</p>
        <p>Raven looked at the hourglass. At tomorrow draining away. At the world ending because she had been too clever, too skilled, too proud. She closed her eyes. Made her choice.</p>
        <p>"Take my time," she said. "Twenty years. Take them from me."</p>
        <p>"You are certain? This cannot be reversed."</p>
        <p>"I'm certain."</p>
        <p>"So be it."</p>
        <p>The figure raised one bronze arm. Its palm opened, and light poured forthâ€”searing, blinding, white as dying stars. The light engulfed her.</p>
        <p>She felt it then. The removal. Not pain, exactly. Absence. A hollowing. Twenty years lifting away like smoke, like morning mist, like dreams at dawn. Her body adjusted, cells rewriting themselves. Her hair grew brittle at the ends. Fine lines appeared at her eyes, her mouth. Her joints acquired aches that had not been there before.</p>
        <p>Twenty years. Gone.</p>
        <p>And in exchange, the figure turned to the hourglass. Machinery respondedâ€”chains lowering delicate tools, lights of impossible colors playing across the crack. She watched the glass knit itself together, molecule by molecule, until no trace of damage remained.</p>
        <p>"Complete. The hourglass is whole."</p>
        <p>Raven stepped forward and took it. Perfect. Warm. The sand flowing smoothly once more.</p>
        <p>"Thank you," she whispered.</p>
        <p>"No thanks are needed. Payment was rendered. Go now. Return it to its place. Tomorrow will resume."</p>
        <p>A new corridor appeared, sloping upward. The way home.</p>
        <p>She turned to leave, then paused. "Why does tomorrow need an hourglass? Can't time just happen?"</p>
        <p>The clock-face regarded her. "Time happens, yes. But direction requires intention. The hourglass provides structure. It is not time itself. It is time's promise. And promises must be kept."</p>
        <p>She nodded slowly. "I understand."</p>
        <p>"Do you? You stole a promise. Broke it. Paid dearly to restore it. Perhaps now you understand that some things are not meant to be taken."</p>
        <p>Raven had no answer. She walked toward the corridor, the repaired hourglass cradled like a child in her arms. Behind her, the Underclock ticked on, measuring the moments that would become the days that would become forever.</p>
        <p>The ascent was swift. Or perhaps time simply worked differently going up. She emerged in the Plaza of Echoes. The tear sealed behind her. Chronus stood waiting, and when his eyes met hers, he saw recognition. Saw him notice the changesâ€”the lines, the brittle hair, the weight in her movements.</p>
        <p>"You paid with your own time."</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"Foolish." But his voice was almost gentle.</p>
        <p>"Maybe." She held out the hourglass. "It's fixed. Make tomorrow start again."</p>
        <p>He took it reverently, cradling it in both hands. "Come. You should witness this."</p>
        <p>They walked to his tower. Climbed the spiral stairs. Reached the uppermost chamber where the pedestal stood empty, waiting.</p>
        <p>Chronus held the hourglass up to the starlight one final time, then placed it back where it belonged.</p>
        <p>For a heartbeat, nothing. Then everything.</p>
        <p>The hourglass began to glow. Soft at first, then brighter, until the light was almost unbearable. It spread outward like water, like music, like joy. It washed over Raven, warm as summer sun, gentle as rain.</p>
        <p>And time remembered how to move.</p>
        <p>She heard itâ€”the city waking. A million clocks starting. Bells ringing. Hearts beating. The great clockwork of existence resuming its eternal dance.</p>
        <p>They stood at the window together and watched the eastern horizon lighten. Gray. Pearl. Rose. Gold.</p>
        <p>The sun rose. Slowly. Majestically. Inevitably. Dawn came. Beautiful, ordinary, impossible dawn.</p>
        <p>Below, people emerged into streets, weeping and laughing and embracing. They did not know how close they had come to eternal darkness. But they knew, somehow, that they had been given a gift. Tomorrow.</p>
        <p>"What will you do now?" Chronus asked.</p>
        <p>"Live," Raven said simply. "I have less time now, so I should use it better."</p>
        <p>"Wise."</p>
        <p>"Will you increase the protections? Make sure no one steals it again?"</p>
        <p>"No. I will do something simpler. I will tell the truth. Let people know what the hourglass is. What it does. Fear is a better guardian than magic."</p>
        <p>Raven descended from the tower for the last time and walked through streets alive with celebration. Her shadow-cloak was goneâ€”lost or taken as paymentâ€”but she did not mind. It felt right to be visible. To be part of the world instead of separate from it.</p>
        <p>She returned to her safe house and counted her wealthâ€”years of stolen gold. She divided it into portions. The largest for the city's orphanage. Another for the watch's widows. A third for the burned library that had never been rebuilt. She kept only enough to live modestly. It felt like freedom.</p>
        <p>Raven never stole again. She opened a shopâ€”small, unassumingâ€”specializing in locks and security. Who better to protect than someone who had spent years learning to break in? The irony was not lost on her.</p>
        <p>Years passed. Her hair turned silver. Her hands grew weathered but steady. She trained apprentices, teaching them not just craft but consequence. How to measure the cost of actions. How one choice can break or remake the world.</p>
        <p>When Raven died at eighty-sevenâ€”which should have been sixty-sevenâ€”she died peacefully, in sunlight, with her work complete and her debts paid.</p>
        <p>And in the Tower of Chronus, the Hourglass of Hours continued its work, measuring tomorrows for a world that would never know how close it came to running out of them.</p>
        <p>All because a thief chose, in the end, not to take but to give. To save tomorrow at the cost of her yesterdays.</p>
        <p>The sand falls. It always falls. Each grain a choice. Each moment a gift.</p>
        <p>And in the falling, time moves forward, as it must, as it will, until the last grain drops and the hourglass turns and tomorrow becomes today becomes the story we tell when night comes and fires burn low.</p>
        <p>The story of the thief who stole tomorrow. And gave it back.</p>
